### General info

In this study the harpacticoids are represented by the extremophilic canthocamptid *Cletocamptus
dominicanus* Kiefer, 1934 and the metid *Metis holothuriae* (Edwards, 1891). Members of genus
*Cletocamptus* Schmankewitsch 1875 (Crustacea, Copepoda, Harpacticoida: Canthocamptidae)
are found throughout the world, most commonly in estuaries and coastal lagoons (Gómez,
Gerber, &amp; Fuentes-Reinés, 2017). Some members of *Cletocamptus* possess regulatory
mechanisms that allow them to tolerate and thrive in a wide range of salinities (Anufriieva, 2015;
Shadrin &amp; Anufriieva, 2013). Ocurring as the most abundant harpacticoid copepods inhabiting
Caribbean coastal saline lagoons (Gómez et al., 2017). *Cletocamptus dominicanus* occur at
extremely high densities in salinities of up to 105 ‰ (salinity ranges from 36-106‰)  (Gómez et
al., 2017). In fact *C. dominicanus*  is the most abundant metazoan organism on the sediments of
the Salinas of Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge (Puerto Rico). *C. dominicanus* can also be
found in other coastal regions of the Caribbean, including Trinidad and Tobago, British Virgin
Islands, US Virgin Islands, Bahamas, Dominican Republic, and Colombia (Gomez et al. 2017).
 Considering *C. dominicanus* adaptations to high salinities and frequent osmotic changes caused
by frequent flooding of coastal lagoons, this species has the potential to function as a model
organism in climate change and adaptation research.  
Similarly, the current records of *Metis holothuriae* suggest a cosmopolitan distribution, but the
large amount of variation that has been reported for this species appears to reinforce the
existence of a species complex (Mielke 1989; Wells 2007; Huys 2016). It is common in
association to phytal and is reported to be an epibiont of the Caribbean Manatee (Violante-
Huerta and E. Suárez-Morales 2016), maybe fortuitously occurring on this species (Huys 2016).
The Longipediidae, in this study represented by *Longipedia americana* Wells, 1980, is a family
composed of 22 species, usually found in shallow-water habitats, on mixed sand and muddy
sediments (Boxshall &amp; Halsey 2004). It is also reported on the Caribbean waters of Jamaica,
Panama, and Mexico (Suárez-Morales et al. 2006).

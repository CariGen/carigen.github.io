### **General info**
The hydrocoral *Millepora* is found in shallow tropical/subtropical regions around the globe and is considered an important reef-building organism. *Millepora alcicornis* is the most common species in the Atlantic Ocean, and can be found from 0.5 to 50 m deep. It is distributed from the tropical/subtropical eastern western Atlantic Ocean, including Bermuda, Brazil, and on the east in Tenerife of the Canary Islands, the Cape Verde Archipelago and Ascension Island. Milleporids provide habitat for many species such as small fish, ophiuroids, barnacles, micro-crustaceans among others. In the Caribbean, milleporids are important reef builders and are commonly found in shallow and turbulent waters forming dense reef rims contributing to the stabilization and complexity of the carbonate structure.

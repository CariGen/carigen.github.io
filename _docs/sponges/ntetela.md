<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/Nicola_tetela.jpg" alt="Nicola_tetela" style="width:100%;max-width:400px">

### **Taxonomy:**  
Eukaryota; Opisthokonta; Metazoa; Porifera; Calcarea; Calcinea; Clathrinida; Clathrinidae; Nicola; tetela  

### **General info**
Although yet a monospecific genus, the distribution of *Nicola tetela* comb. nov. is not restricted to a unique
locality nor depth. This species occurs in the South of Bahia (Brazil) (Borojevic & Peixinho 1976) and in Curaçao,
and from 5.6 m to 47 m of depth, which suggests that it may be present at least from the Northeast of Brazil up to
the Caribbean Sea. New studies will probably widen the distribution of *Nicola tetela* comb. nov. and perhaps result
in the discovery of other species of this genus (Condor-Lujan & Klautau 2016). The species has also been collected
by Jaaziel E. Garcia-Hernandez from Puerto Rico, St. Eustatius, Curaçao, and Bonaire.
